# WebScraper-GoLang
Web scraping, also known as web data extraction, is the process of extracting data from websites. This data can be in various formats, such as HTML, XML, JSON, or plain text. It involves using software to automatically fetch and parse web pages, extracting the desired information and storing it in a structured format.


# Follow this step-by-step tutorial to learn basic to advanced techniques for scraping data easily in Golang using popular scraping libraries like Colly and Chromedp.
Let's start!
Prerequisites

Set Up the Environment

# Here are the prerequisites you have to meet for this tutorial:

•	A Go IDE: Visual Studio Code with the Go extension is recommended.
Open the links above to download, install, and set up the required tools by following their installation wizards.

# Set Up a Go Project
After installing Go, it's time to initialize your Golang web scraper project. Create a web-scraper-go folder and enter it in your terminal:
Terminal
mkdir web-scraper-go 
cd web-scraper-go
# Launch a Go module with the following command:
Terminal
go mod init scraper
The init command will initialize a scraper Go module inside your project root folder. You should now see a go.mod file with the following content in your root folder:
go.mod
module scraper
go 1.22.0
# Note that the last line can change depending on your Go version.
